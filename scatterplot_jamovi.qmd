## About

A scatterplot is a graph that shows the relationship between two variables by displaying data points on a Cartesian plane. Each point represents an observation with its position determined by the values of the two variables. Scatterplots help identify trends, clusters, and outliers in the data.

## Assumed knowledge
- You have Jamovi installed ideally 2.5.7.0 or later.
- You can follow instructions to select, click and drag elements in Jamovi.

## Data structure
The data should be in a **long format** (also known as tidy data), where each row is an observation and each column is a variable (@fig-format). If your data is not already structured this way, reshape it manually in a spreadsheet program or in R using the `pivot_longer()` function from the `tidyr` package.


::: {layout="[ 0.4, -0.1, 0.4 ]" #fig-format}

:::: {#first-column}
```{r}
#| echo: false
possums <- readxl::read_excel("possum_bw.xlsx")
possums |>
  head(8) |>
  gt() |>
  opt_stylize(style = 5, color = "red")
```
:::

::: {#second-column}
```{r}
#| echo: false
possums |>
  group_by(Sex) |>
  mutate(row = row_number()) |>
  pivot_wider(names_from = Sex, values_from = BW) |>
  select(-row) |>
  head(4) |>
  gt() |>
  opt_stylize(style = 5, color = "red")
```
:::

Data should be in long format (left) where each row is an observation and each column is a variable. This is the preferred format for most statistical software. Wide format (right) is also common, but may require additional steps to analyse or visualise in some instances.

## Data
For this cheatsheet we have two separate datasets. The first is part of the possums dataset used in [BIOL2022](https://www.sydney.edu.au/units/BIOL2022) labs. Two numerical variables are available: `ExpBLUP` and `AactiveTBLUP`. The data is available in the file `possums-blup.csv`.

{{< downloadthis possums-blup.csv dname="possums-blup" label="possums-blup.csv" type="primary" >}}

The second dataset is data were collected and made available by Dr. Kristen Gorman and the Palmer Station, Antarctica LTER, a member of the Long Term Ecological Research Network. The day may be downloaded manually but is available below as `penguins.csv`.

{{< downloadthis penguins.csv dname="penguins" label="penguins.csv" type="primary" >}}


## Import data

1. Click on the Menu icon: ![](assets/jamovimenu.png){width=20px}
2. Select Open > Browse, and navigate to the downloaded file. 
3. Click Open to load the data.

## Plot

1. Click on the **Analyses** tab.
2. Select **Exploration** > **Scatterplot**.
3. Drag the variables you want to plot into the X and Y boxes. The variables should both be numerical.
4. If you want to colour the points by a categorical variable, drag the categorical variable into the **Color** box.
5. Explore the options for **Regression Line** and **Marginals** by clicking on them. **Note**: *depending on the version of Jamovi, these options may be located in different places or will not be available. The point is that you can explore additionality fucntionality with ease.*
6. Rename variables by clicking on the variable name in the **Variables** tab.
