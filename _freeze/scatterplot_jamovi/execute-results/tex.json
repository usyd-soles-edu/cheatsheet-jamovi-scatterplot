Each point represents an observation with its position determined by the values of the two variables. Scatterplots help identify trends, clusters, and outliers in the data.\n\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n## Assumed knowledge\n- You have Jamovi installed ideally 2.5.7.0 or later.\n- You can follow instructions to select, click and drag elements in Jamovi.\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-important collapse=\"true\"}\n## Data structure\nThe data should be in a **long format** (also known as tidy data), where each row is an observation and each column is a variable (@fig-format). If your data is not already structured this way, reshape it manually in a spreadsheet program or in R using the `pivot_longer()` function from the `tidyr` package.\n\n\n::: {layout=\"[ 0.4, -0.1, 0.4 ]\" #fig-format}\n\n:::: {#first-column}\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\\begin{table}\n\\fontsize{12.0pt}{14.4pt}\\selectfont\n\\begin{tabular*}{\\linewidth}{@{\\extracolsep{\\fill}}lr}\n\\toprule\nSex & BW \\\\ \n\\midrule\\addlinespace[2.5pt]\nF & 2.15 \\\\ \nM & 2.55 \\\\ \nF & 2.95 \\\\ \nF & 2.70 \\\\ \nM & 2.20 \\\\ \nF & 1.85 \\\\ \nM & 2.55 \\\\ \nM & 2.60 \\\\ \n\\bottomrule\n\\end{tabular*}\n\\end{table}\n\n:::\n:::\n\n:::\n\n::: {#second-column}\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\\begin{table}\n\\fontsize{12.0pt}{14.4pt}\\selectfont\n\\begin{tabular*}{\\linewidth}{@{\\extracolsep{\\fill}}rr}\n\\toprule\nF & M \\\\ \n\\midrule\\addlinespace[2.5pt]\n2.15 & 2.55 \\\\ \n2.95 & 2.20 \\\\ \n2.70 & 2.55 \\\\ \n1.85 & 2.60 \\\\ \n\\bottomrule\n\\end{tabular*}\n\\end{table}\n\n:::\n:::\n\n:::\n\nData should be in long format (left) where each row is an observation and each column is a variable. This is the preferred format for most statistical software. Wide format (right) is also common, but may require additional steps to analyse or visualise in some instances.\n::::\n:::\n\n## Data\nFor this cheatsheet we have two separate datasets. The first is part of the possums dataset used in [BIOL2022](https://www.sydney.edu.au/units/BIOL2022) labs. Two numerical variables are available: `ExpBLUP` and `AactiveTBLUP`. The data is available in the file `possums-blup.csv`.\n\n{{< downloadthis possums-blup.csv dname=\"possums-blup\" label=\"possums-blup.csv\" type=\"primary\" >}}\n\nThe second dataset is data were collected and made available by Dr. Kristen Gorman and the Palmer Station, Antarctica LTER, a member of the Long Term Ecological Research Network. The day may be downloaded manually but is available below as `penguins.csv`.\n\n{{< downloadthis penguins.csv dname=\"penguins\" label=\"penguins.csv\" type=\"primary\" >}}\n\n\n## Import data\n\n1. Click on the Menu icon: ![](assets/jamovimenu.png){width=20px}\n2. Select Open > Browse, and navigate to the downloaded file. \n3. Click Open to load the data.\n\n::: {.content-visible unless-format=\"pdf\"}\n![](assets/open-file-in-jamovi.gif)\n:::\n\n## Plot\n\n1. Click on the **Analyses** tab.\n2. Select **Exploration** > **Scatterplot**.\n3. Drag the variables you want to plot into the X and Y boxes. The variables should both be numerical.\n4. If you want to colour the points by a categorical variable, drag the categorical variable into the **Color** box.\n5. Explore the options for **Regression Line** and **Marginals** by clicking on them. **Note**: *depending on the version of Jamovi, these options may be located in different places or will not be available. The point is that you can explore additionality fucntionality with ease.*\n6. Rename variables by clicking on the variable name in the **Variables** tab.\n\n::: {.content-visible unless-format=\"pdf\"}\n![](assets/scatterplot-jamovi.gif)\n:::\n\n\n## Export\n\nTo export the plot, right click on the plot, select Image > Export... > Browse and rename the file before clicking on the Save button.\n\n![A popup window should appear when you right click on a plot, where you can export the image.
